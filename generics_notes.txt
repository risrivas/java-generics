# 01 module is better to go with pdf and source code demo - GenericBuffer class is good
# 02 module is only about collections - very basic

# 03 module is most important - inheritance
- if we want to call methods on generic types - like T.compareTo() or T.trade() - then use type bounds - extends and super
