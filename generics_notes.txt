# 01 module is better to go with pdf and source code demo - GenericBuffer class is good
# 02 module is only about collections - very basic

#################
# 03 module is most important - inheritance
#################
- if we want to call methods on generic types - like T.compareTo() or T.trade() - then use type bounds - extends and super
- in a comparator or comparable, always left arg is compared to right arg

#################
# 04 module is generics on methods
#################
- only scoped on that method only
- T is placed before return type

- example:
public static <T> T min(List<T> values, Comparator<T> comparator) {}

#################
# 05 - wildcards
#################
- best explanation:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4343202/difference-between-super-t-and-extends-t-in-java/4343547#4343547

- example:
1) List<? extends Cls>
- only want to read Cls or subclasses of Cls
- can not write or add anything to the list

2) List<? super Cls>
- only want to write or add Cls or subclasses of Cls to the list
- can only read Object but dont know which subclass of Object

3) List<Cls>
- read and write to the list of type Cls

4) List<?>
- use <?> instead of <? extends Object>


- when we want to save all the subclasses of a parent class as a list - can use upperbound - List<? extends Person>
- below 2 lines of code are equivalent:
public void saveAll(final List<? extends Person> people)
public <T extends Person> void saveAll(final List<T> people)

- use ? for methods arguments
- use T for generic class as T will be needed to declare fields / return value from getters

# PECS:
Remember PECS: "Producer Extends, Consumer Super".

- "Producer Extends" - If you need a List to produce T values (you want to read Ts from the list), you need to declare it with ? extends T, e.g. List<? extends Integer>.
But you cannot add to this list.

- "Consumer Super" - If you need a List to consume T values (you want to write Ts into the list), you need to declare it with ? super T, e.g. List<? super Integer>.
But there are no guarantees what type of object you may read from this list.

- If you need to both read from and write to a list, you need to declare it exactly with no wildcards, e.g. List<Integer>.
