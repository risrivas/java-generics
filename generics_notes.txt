# 01 module is better to go with pdf and source code demo - GenericBuffer class is good
# 02 module is only about collections - very basic

# 03 module is most important - inheritance
- if we want to call methods on generic types - like T.compareTo() or T.trade() - then use type bounds - extends and super
- in a comparator or comparable, always left arg is compared to right arg

# 04 module is generics on methods
- only scoped on that method only
- T is placed before return type

- example:
public static <T> T min(List<T> values, Comparator<T> comparator) {}
